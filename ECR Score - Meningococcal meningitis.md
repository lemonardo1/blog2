I’m not aware of any official “1–10” mortality or severity scale where a common cold (감기) is 1 and death is 10. However, if you’re using that as a rough, casual indicator of how life-threatening a condition can be, meningococcal meningitis (수막구균성 뇌수막염) is very serious—much more dangerous than a typical cold.

In terms of overall severity:

- 감기(Cold) = 1 (very low risk of death)
- 수막구균성 뇌수막염(Meningococcal meningitis) ≈ 8 (serious infection; fatality rates can be 10–15% if not treated promptly)
- 사망(Death) = 10

#### Why around 8?

- Meningococcal meningitis can progress rapidly and cause significant mortality or long-term complications if not treated immediately.
- With appropriate antibiotics and medical support, many patients do recover, which means it’s not at the very top (10), but given its sudden onset and potential for severe outcomes, it’s certainly toward the high end of the scale.
