Postoperative diseases generally refer to complications or adverse conditions that occur after a surgical procedure. These complications can vary widely in nature and severity. Below is an overview of the main categories:

---

### 1. **Infectious Complications**

- **Surgical Site Infections (SSI):**  
    Infections that occur at or near the incision site, which can be superficial or deep.
- **Systemic Infections:**  
    These include bacteremia or sepsis, where the infection spreads to the bloodstream.
- **Urinary Tract Infections (UTI):**  
    Often related to catheter use during and after surgery.

### 2. **Cardiovascular Complications**

- **Myocardial Infarction:**  
    The stress of surgery can trigger a heart attack, especially in patients with preexisting heart conditions.
- **Cardiac Arrhythmias:**  
    Abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, may occur postoperatively.
- **Thromboembolic Events:**  
    Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are significant risks, particularly in immobilized patients.

### 3. **Respiratory Complications**

- **Atelectasis:**  
    Partial collapse of the lung, often due to shallow breathing after surgery.
- **Pneumonia:**  
    Infection of the lungs, which can be related to reduced mobility and impaired cough reflex.
- **Respiratory Failure:**  
    In severe cases, the patient may require ventilatory support.

### 4. **Gastrointestinal Complications**

- **Postoperative Ileus:**  
    A temporary paralysis of the intestines leading to delayed bowel function and discomfort.
- **Anastomotic Leak:**  
    Leakage from a surgical connection between two parts of the bowel, potentially causing peritonitis.
- **Bowel Obstruction:**  
    Adhesions or scar tissue can form, leading to a blockage in the intestines.

### 5. **Neurological and Cognitive Complications**

- **Postoperative Delirium:**  
    Acute confusion and cognitive impairment, particularly common in older adults.
- **Cognitive Dysfunction:**  
    Some patients may experience longer-lasting cognitive deficits following surgery.
- **Stroke:**  
    Although less common, ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes may occur, especially in high-risk patients.

### 6. **Other Complications**

- **Hemorrhage:**  
    Excessive bleeding during or after surgery can lead to anemia and may require transfusions.
- **Wound Dehiscence:**  
    The reopening of a surgical incision due to poor healing.
- **Acute Kidney Injury:**  
    Can result from factors like low blood pressure or exposure to nephrotoxic agents during surgery.
- **Thrombotic Microangiopathy:**  
    A rare but severe condition involving small blood vessel clots.

**Risk Factors:**  
The likelihood of these postoperative diseases depends on multiple factors, including the patientâ€™s age, overall health, the type and duration of surgery, and perioperative care practices.

Managing these complications requires early detection, preventive strategies, and, when necessary, prompt intervention. Continuous improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative care aim to reduce the incidence and severity of these complications.
