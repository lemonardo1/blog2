## Corporate History

The merger of Essilor and Luxottica in 2018 brought together two industry giants:

- Essilor: Founded in 1849, became a leader in lens manufacturing and optical technology[10].
- Luxottica: Established in 1961 by Leonardo Del Vecchio, grew into a major eyewear designer and manufacturer[10].

This strategic merger created a vertically integrated company covering every step of the eyewear value chain, from design and development to distribution[6].

EssilorLuxottica continues to expand its market dominance through strategic acquisitions, such as the €7.2 billion acquisition of Grandvision in 2019[9].
