Grifols is a global healthcare company founded in Barcelona, Spain in 1909[1][4]. With a rich history spanning over a century, Grifols has established itself as a leader in the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industry, particularly in the field of plasma-derived medicines[1][6].

## Key Business Divisions

This division is the cornerstone of Grifols' operations, producing plasma-derived protein therapies for patients with rare, chronic, and life-threatening conditions[3]. In 2020, the Bioscience Division generated revenues of EUR 4,243 million, representing a 6.2% growth[8].

**Diagnostic Division**
Grifols provides transfusion medicine, hemostasis, and immunoassay solutions for blood banks, clinical laboratories, and transfusion centers[3]. This division saw a 5.8% growth in 2020, reaching EUR 776 million in revenue, partly due to sales of molecular tests to detect SARS-CoV-2[8].

## Recent Developments
