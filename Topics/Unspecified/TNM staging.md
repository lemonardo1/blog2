[[Tumor]] [[Node]] [[Matastasis]]
3가지 기준을 종합하여 결정한다.

T staging
암의 침윤 깊이 또는 암의 크기로 판정한다.
[[Solid organ]]은 암의 크기로 판정하고
[[Hollow organ]] 은 암의 조직 침윤 깊이로 판정한다.

N staging
림프절 전이로 판정한다.
전이된 주변 림프절 개수나, 중요한 림프절로의 전이된 경우
멀리 떨어진 림프절로의 전이는 원격전이로, N이 아닌 M staging에 반영한다.


M staging
전이된 장기를 기준으로 판단한다.
타 장기, 원격 림프절(먼 림프절)로의 전이가 많이 된 경우

The TNM staging system is a globally recognized standard for classifying the anatomical extent of cancer spread[1]. Developed by Pierre Denoix between 1943 and 1952, it has become the most widely used cancer staging system by medical professionals worldwide[1][2].

## Components of TNM Staging

The TNM system consists of three main components:

**T (Tumor)**: Describes the size and extent of the primary tumor[3].
**N (Node)**: Indicates the number of nearby lymph nodes involved[3].
**M (Metastasis)**: Refers to whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body[3].

## Significance and Application

TNM staging serves several important purposes:

1. Predicting prognosis
2. Guiding treatment selection
3. Assessing treatment response
4. Facilitating communication among healthcare professionals
5. Standardizing clinical research[5]

## Staging Process

Doctors use various tests to determine the TNM stage, including:

- Physical exams
- Imaging studies (X-rays, CT scans, PET scans)
- Laboratory tests
- Pathology reports from biopsies and surgeries[2]

## Stage Grouping

Based on the TNM classifications, cancers are typically grouped into stages I-IV, with higher numbers indicating more advanced disease[7]:

| Stage | Description | TNM Classification |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 0 | Carcinoma in situ | Tis, N0, M0 |
| I | Localized cancer | T1-T2, N0, M0 |
| II | Locally advanced, early | T1-T2, N1, M0 |
| III | Locally advanced, late | T1-T4, N2-N3, M0 |
| IV | Metastatic cancer | T1-T4, N1-N3, M1 |

## Maintenance and Updates

The TNM system is maintained by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)[1]. It undergoes periodic revisions to incorporate new research and improve its accuracy. The most recent edition, the eighth, was published in 2017[5].

While the TNM system is applicable to most solid tumors, it is not used for leukemia or tumors of the central nervous system[1]. Some cancer types may have specific staging systems tailored to their unique characteristics[4].
