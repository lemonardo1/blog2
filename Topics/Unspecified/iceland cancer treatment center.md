# iceland cancer treatment center

Iceland's primary cancer treatment center is Landspitali, the National University Hospital of Iceland in Reykjavik. More than 90 percent of cancer patients in Iceland receive their cancer treatment at this facility[^1]. The hospital employs social workers and conducts distress screening for cancer patients in the outpatient wards[^1].

In addition to Landspitali, Iceland has several support organizations and services for cancer patients:

1. The Icelandic Cancer Society (ICS): An umbrella organization with 27 member associations that focuses on prevention, education, research, and patient services[^3]. The ICS offers:
    - A Counseling and Patient Support Center (CPSC) in Reykjavik, providing information, education, and psychosocial support at no cost[^1][^3].
    - Support group sessions and psycho-educational classes[^1].
    - Eight co-owned apartments in Reykjavik for patients from rural areas to stay during treatment[^3][^4].
2. Ljósið: An independent rehabilitation and support center for cancer patients and their families, founded in 2005[^4][^6].
3. Local service centers: Some smaller communities have opened cancer support centers that work with the ICS and its Counseling Service[^3][^4].

Iceland maintains a universal healthcare system, covering all legal residents through the Icelandic Social Insurance Administration. The system is primarily funded by taxes and partly by service fees[^1].

For those seeking information or support, the ICS Counseling Services can be reached at 800-4040[^4].
