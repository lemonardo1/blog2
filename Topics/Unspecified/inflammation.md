Inflammation is a biological response of the body's immune system to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is a protective mechanism that helps to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out damaged cells and tissues, and establish a repair process. However, chronic inflammation can contribute to various diseases and conditions.

There are two types of inflammation:

1. **Acute Inflammation**: This is the immediate response to an injury or infection. It is characterized by redness, heat, swelling, pain, and sometimes loss of function in the affected area. Acute inflammation usually resolves quickly as the body heals.

2. **Chronic Inflammation**: This occurs when the inflammatory response persists over a longer period. It can result from persistent infections, prolonged exposure to irritants, or autoimmune responses where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues. Chronic inflammation is associated with various health conditions such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers.

Managing inflammation involves identifying and addressing its causes and may include medications like anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., NSAIDs or corticosteroids), lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise modifications, and stress management techniques. If you suspect you have an inflammatory condition, itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.
